Textures Extractor/Reinserter v1.0b5 by Vash -www.romhacking.it-

This tool extracts and inserts Tim2/Tim3 and Gim files from any file (obviously in raw).

The peculiarity of the Tim2/3 process is that can handle the tim2/3 archives and can extract them allowing you to modify the images one by one and reinserting them on-the-fly

-> TextER [option] [file] [type]

OPTION:

-e file [extract the files]
-c file [insert the textures extracted in the original file]

TYPE:

-tm [TIM2 & TIM3 (PS2)]
-gim [GIM (PSP)]
